## Description 

 
* The motivation on making this project was to be able to make everyday shopping a little easier for the everyday consumer 

* we went and built this project so we can show what we had learned and apply what we learned and made something to be easily accessable 

* we learned mainly how to effectively work as a group on one single project and simultaneously work on one code and push and pull from the repo without any errors  

* it solves the problem of shopping and having to manuver a complicated site and simplify it for the average consumer 

* we did learn how to work as a team remotely and learn how to susscesfully pull clone and push into one shared Repo
